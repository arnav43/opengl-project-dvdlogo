This project is a fun simulation of the classic **DVD screensaver** where the **DVD logo bounces around the screen**, changing color every time it hits a corner. The simulation is built using **OpenGL**, **GLFW**, and **GLM**, and features smooth movement with slight velocity variations for a more dynamic effect.  

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Realistic DVD logo movement** with velocity adjustments.  
- **Color change on corner collisions**, chosen randomly from a predefined set of colors.  
- **Textured DVD logo** using **stb_image.h**.  
- **GLSL shaders** for rendering and color updates.  
- **Smooth animation loop** with OpenGL optimizations.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **OpenGL** for rendering  
- **GLFW** for window management  
- **GLM** for matrix transformations  
- **stb_image.h** for texture loading  
- **C++** for logic and structure  

## üöÄ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DVD-Logo-Screensaver.git
   cd DVD-Logo-Screensaver
2. Install dependencies (GLFW, OpenGL, GLM)
3. Compile & run the program
4. Enjoy the Screensaver!

## üî• Future Improvements
1. Add dynamic speed adjustments based on screen size.
2. Implement elastic collisions for more realistic physics.
3. Introduce randomized initial velocities for variation.
